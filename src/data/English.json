    "title": "Introduction to Mark",
    "html": "<h6>Good news for people in crisis</h6><p>The humility and power of Jesus inspires faith and endurance</p><h6>How to read Mark</h6><p>All-news radio and TV stations capture the highlights of the world’s news in thirty minutes. Mark’s gospel offers a similar fast-paced report on the story of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Out of obscurity, this unique God-man explodes into the headlines as he preaches, performs miracles, and encounters both great popularity and deadly opposition. It is the greatest news story of all time.</p><p>Written by a young man who worked alongside the fisherman who had lived the story, this account is strong on action and wastes no extra words, giving us a vivid, firsthand portrayal of Jesus. His actions are center stage, as he “came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Mar 10:45). We see him hard at work, helping people in need, healing those who were sick, encouraging those who were without hope, setting free those who were in bondage, enlightening those who were in darkness.</p><p>Mark’s action-packed account of Jesus’ life culminates by immersing us in details of the suffering and sacrifice of his final week on earth. These powerful stories were written to strengthen the Roman believers suffering persecution, to both live and die fearlessly. Consider the implications of following the example of the supreme Servant, who calls you to a ministry of servanthood.</p><h6>Who wrote this book?</h6><p>John Mark, the son of a Jerusalem widow whose home was a meeting place for early believers (see Acts 12:12). Mark served as Peter’s translator, so he most likely recorded the events as he heard them firsthand. So, though Mark wrote the words, it could be said that this book is the gospel according to Peter.</p><h6>When was it written?</h6><p>This account was probably written during the terrible persecution of Emperor Nero, close to the time of Peter’s execution. This would be after the burning of Rome in July, AD 64 but before the fall of Jerusalem to Roman armies in August, AD 70.</p><h6>To whom was it written and why?</h6><p>The book’s distinctly non-Jewish flavor and notable allusions to Roman customs make it clear that it was written for believers in Rome. The Roman Empire, the dominant world power, had begun to persecute Christians. Mark wanted to encourage these suffering believers.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>The overall breakdown of this book shows us that about 53 percent of Mark are the words of The Narrator (black); 35 percent are Jesus’ words (red); 3 percent are the disciples’ (green); and 9 percent are all others’ (blue). Clearly Jesus is the central person in this book. He speaks about 156 times compared to almost 40 different green speaking parts and more than a 100 distinct blue passages. And yet, this book which conveys Peter’s testimony of Jesus’ life and ministry, highlights the experiences of the disciples in a special way. As a group, the disciples intervene about 19 times. Simon Peter has the lead role among them, speaking nine times. Other disciples who have a speaking part are John, James, Andrew, and Judas Iscariot.</p><p>Peter’s words focus on who Jesus is. The very first time he speaks he says to Jesus, “You are the Christ.” (8:29). It seems like he’s really got it, but in his longest speech Peter shows that he still doesn’t grasp the uniqueness of Jesus. On the Mount of Transfiguration he says that they will “make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah” (9:5). Then things get even worse. The last two times he speaks he denies who Jesus is and any relationship with him (14:68; 14:71). Through his story Peter thus identifies himself with other believers who sometimes are certain in their faith, sometimes confused about what’s central, and at other times afraid of identifying with Jesus. This must have been pastorally comforting for Mark’s original hearers going through Nero’s great persecution.</p><p>Who is Jesus? Amazed by his displays of power, Jesus’ disciples ask, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?” (4:41). But this question is not only raised by Jesus’ followers. It is also posed both by the top religious (14:61) and political authorities in Jerusalem (15:2). But Mark’s gospel leaves the reader with no doubt as to who Jesus really is. God speaks only twice and both times affirms that Jesus is the “dearly loved Son.” Neither is there any doubt when demons speak. On every occasion that they have a speaking part they affirm Jesus’ divinity (1:2; 3:11; 5:7).</p><p>All of this is set within the bookmarks of the first and last blue sections of Mark spoken by humans. The book opens with the affirmation that Jesus is “mightier” than the most devout of religious leaders (1:7). The books ends with an amazing confession from an unexpected source: “Truly this man was the Son of God!” (15:39).</p><p>Faced with who Jesus is, Mark’s gospel calls his audience to faith. SourceView enables us to discover that the individual with the largest speaking role outside of the disciples is the father of a very sick boy whose life hung in the balance. In this life and death crisis, the father cries out to Jesus, “I believe. Help my unbelief!” (9:24). Many of Mark’s original readers, facing their own life and death crises because of the Roman persecution, would have identified with this father and taken courage to pray a similar prayer. For this very reason, Mark includes much teaching from Jesus on what it means to believe and have faith in God (reflect on 1:15; 4:13-20; 4:40; 5:34; 9:19; 9:23b; 9:39-50; 10:52; 11:22-25; 16:15-18).</p>"

    "html": "<h6>A Savior for all people</h6><p>The pivotal event of history—God steps in to seek and save the lost</p><h6>How to read Luke</h6><p>Each gospel has its own particular flavor as each author portrays unique aspects of Jesus’ life and ministry. Luke, one of Paul’s disciples, was a non-Jewish physician from the Roman province of Macedonia. He did not experience the gospel events first-hand, but carefully researched the facts from those who had been eye witnesses (Luk 1:1-3). His keen investigation brings to light some priceless stories that are not told in the other gospel accounts. Luke wanted to be sure he told the full story, including rich details of Jesus’ birth, life, death, and resurrection.</p><p>Luke’s is a very personal gospel. We observe many individuals meeting one-on-one with Jesus in transformational encounters—people who were often marginalized and cast off by religious society: women, foreigners, the sick, the lost, the broken, the poor, the needy, the suffering, the powerless, and the despised. Only Luke records the parable of the Good Samaritan. Only Luke includes three more parables and places them at the heart of his story, in chapter 15. They are the parables of a lost coin, a lost sheep, and a lost son. All three highlight the central message of the book that can best be summed up in the words of Jesus: “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost” (Luk 19:10).</p><h6>Who wrote this book and when?</h6><p>Luke, a Gentile medical doctor and a companion of Paul the apostle, probably wrote the gospel between AD 59 and 63. He also wrote the New Testament book of Acts. This two volume work follows an interesting geographical organization:</p><br /><table style='max-width:500px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 13px'> <tr> <th style='width:35%'>Reference</th> <th>Geographical Organization</th> </tr><tr> <th>Luke 1:1-4:13</th> <th>Jesus’ birth, childhood, and baptism</th> </tr><tr> <th>Luke 4:14-9:50</th> <th>Jesus’ ministry in Galilee and beyond</th> </tr><tr> <th>Luke 9:51-19:35</th> <th>Jesus’ ministry en route to Jerusalem (note Luk 9:53; 10:38; 13:22; 17:11; 18:31; 19:11, 28)</th> </tr><tr> <th>Luke 19:36-24:53</th> <th>Jesus’ ministry in Jerusalem</th> </tr><tr> <th>Acts 1:1-7:60</th> <th>The church’s ministry in Jerusalem</th> </tr><tr> <th>Acts 8:1-12:25</th> <th>The church’s ministry in all of Judea and Samaria</th> </tr><tr> <th>Acts 13:1-28:31</th> <th>The church’s ministry to the ends of the earth (see Act 1:8)</th> </tr></table><br /><h6>To whom was it written and why?</h6><p>Luke wrote to Theophilus, probably a Gentile who was either a new believer or someone seeking to learn about Jesus. Theophilus means “lover of God,” leading some to think the book was written to people who loved God. Luke hoped Theophilus and other readers would learn that God’s love reaches out to enfold people from all nations—Jews and Gentiles alike.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>The total supporting cast (blue text) found in the four gospels comprises 99 different individuals or groups. Eight of them are found in all four gospels. They are the indispensable players in the story of Jesus. They include: John the Baptist, The Crowd, The Pharisees, Jewish Leaders, Pontius Pilate, Bystanders at the Trial, A Servant Girl, and Roman Soldiers.</p><p>Then there are 32 cast members who speak in multiple gospels but not in all of them. They include eleven who speak in the first three gospels; one who has a voice in all but Luke, and one in all but Mark. In addition six speak only in Matthew and Mark; four in Matthew and Luke; four in Mark and Luke; one in Mark and John; and four in Luke and John. Can you discover them all?</p><p>This leaves 59 cast members, each of whom has a speaking part in only one gospel account. Reflection on the unique contribution of each of these helps the reader discover the distinctive focus of each gospel story. Of these 30 are found in three gospels (7 in Matthew, 5 in Mark, and 18 in John). Can you discover who they are and reflect on why each author decided to include their words into their gospel narrative? That means that nearly half of these unique players (28 to be precise!) find their voice only in the gospel of Luke. They include:</p><br /><ul><li>Cleopas</li><li>Cleopas &amp; Cleopas’ Companion</li><li>A Dinner Guest</li><li>Elizabeth</li><li>Elizabeth’s Neighbors</li><li>Gabriel</li><li>A Host of Angels</li><li>One of Ten Lepers</li><li>The Owners of the Colt</li><li>People in Capernaum</li><li>People in Judea</li><li>People in Nain</li><li>The Pharisees &amp; the Religious Leaders</li><li>The Repentant Thief</li><li>A Roman Officer’s Friends</li><li>Shepherds near Bethlehem</li><li>Simeon</li><li>Simon the Pharisee</li><li>Some Elders</li><li>Some in Simon’s Home</li><li>Someone Along the Road</li><li>Someone from the Crowd</li><li>A Synagogue Leader</li><li>Ten Lepers</li><li>The Unrepentant Thief</li><li>A Woman in the Crowd</li><li>Zacchaeus</li><li>Zechariah</li></ul><br /><p>Reading the words of these members of the cast will help you discover the special perspective that Luke brings to the gospel story. Seek to uncover other passages that are unique to Luke— not found in the other three gospels. Then take time to meditate on why Luke included them in his narrative. You might discover little treasures by focusing on these unique passages, as illustrated below:<br /><br /><table style='font-size: 15px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto'> <tr> <th colspan='2' style='text-align:center'>John’s Birth Foretold<br />(Luke 1:5-25)</th> <th colspan='2' style='text-align:center'>Jesus’ Birth Foretold<br />(Luke 1:26-56)</th> </tr><tr> <th>1:11</th> <th>Gabriel sent</th> <th>1:26</th> <th>Gabriel sent</th> </tr><tr> <th>1:13</th> <th>Elizabeth will bear a son</th> <th>1:31</th> <th>Mary will give birth to a son</th> </tr><tr> <th>1:17</th> <th>to make ready a people</th> <th>1:33</th> <th>to reign over the house of Jacob</th> </tr><tr> <th>1:18</th> <th>How can this be?

    "title": "Introduction to John",
    "html": "<h6>That you may believe</h6><p>Jesus revealed as the Son of God, full of grace and truth</p><h6>How to read John</h6><p>In Jesus’ day, as in ours, there were many competing belief systems—all trying to connect with a spiritual reality beyond ourselves. One major religion features a god of power and revenge; another worships one that is silent and indifferent to the suffering of people; still another offers a god that is mysterious and unknowable, absorbing all of humanity into a great cosmic ocean of oneness. Some people worship “gods” of possessions, fame, and entertainment. Only one faith—Christianity—worships an amazing, personal being known primarily for his sacrificial love. This book profiles that unique God, revealed in the person of Jesus Christ—God in human flesh.</p><p>In this account of Jesus’ life, you will be confronted with some astonishing claims about who he is and what he came to do. John tells us that he has selected only a few of the many noteworthy things Jesus did in order to help us understand who Jesus is. He records only seven miracles, climaxing in Jesus’ resurrection. For John these signs give indisputable proof that Jesus is the Son of God. There is more, John says, but “the world itself wouldn’t have room for the books that would be written” (Joh 21:25) had he recorded all of Jesus’ mighty signs. So why has he told us these select stories? To elicit a response of faith in our hearts, “that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name” (Joh 20:31).</p><p>Note some unique features of John’s gospel. He uses the images of light and life to describe God’s activity in the world. He includes several of Jesus’ sermons not found in the other gospels (3:10-21; 5:19-47; 9:41-10:5; 10:7-18; 10:25-30; 13:7; 13:8; 13:10; 13:12-20; 13:21; 13:26; 13:27; 13:31-35; 13:36; 13:38-14:4; 14:6-7; 14:9-21; 14:23-16; 16:19-28; 16:31-33; 17:1-26). He highlights Jesus’ many “I am” statements. Jesus declares he is the Messiah, the bread of life from heaven, the one sent by God, the light of the world, the door, the good shepherd, the Son of God, the resurrection, the life, the way, the truth, the true vine, and the King of the Jews. These statements should give you ample reason to believe!</p><h6>Who wrote this book?</h6><p>John, the apostle—one of the original twelve disciples of Jesus.</p><h6>When and where was it written?</h6><p>Sometime between AD 80 and 95 (although some scholars argue that the book can be dated as early as the 50s and no later than 70). John was probably in Ephesus, a city located in modern-day Turkey.</p><h6>To whom was it written?</h6><p>Non-Jewish followers of Jesus, particularly those struggling with Greek philosophies, which taught that salvation comes through special knowledge and that Jesus was divine but not truly human. John insists that salvation is received by believing in God’s Son, Jesus, who came in human flesh.</p><h6>Why was it written?</h6><p>John himself clearly states his goal (see Joh 20:31). His writes the gospel with an evangelistic objective. He wants people to have eternal life by knowing Jesus Christ.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>In John, three of the twelve disciples have no speaking part: Matthew-Levi, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot (see the introduction to Matthew). Nine do in John—much more than the other three gospel accounts. The disciple with the smallest speaking part is James—his own brother! Isn’t that typical of a sibling?</p><p>Note the number of words attributed to each disciple within each gospel:<br /><br /><table style='font-size: 15px; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto'> <tr> <th></th> <th style='width: 12%'>Mat</th> <th style='width: 12%'>Mar</th> <th style='width: 12%'>Luk</th> <th style='width: 12%'>Joh</th> </tr><tr> <th>Simon Peter</th> <th>157</th> <th>120</th> <th>155</th> <th>130</th> </tr><tr> <th>Andrew</th> <th>-</th> <th>20</th> <th>17</th> <th>30</th> </tr><tr> <th>John the Disciple</th> <th>3</th> <th>100</th> <th>65</th> <th>8</th> </tr><tr> <th>James the Disciple</th> <th>3</th> <th>77</th> <th>38</th> <th>7</th> </tr><tr> <th>Philip the Disciple</th> <th>-</th> <th>-</th> <th>-</th> <th>55</th> </tr><tr> <th>Nathaniel-Bartholomew</th> <th>-</th> <th>-</th> <th>-</th> <th>25</th> </tr><tr> <th>Thomas</th> <th>-</th> <th>-</th> <th>-</th> <th>50</th> </tr><tr> <th>Judas-Thaddaeus</th> <th>-</th> <th>-</th> <th>-</th> <th>18</th> </tr><tr> <th>Judas Iscariot</th> <th>40</th> <th>16</th> <th>-</th> <th>14</th> </tr></table><br />In all four gospel narratives, Simon Peter has the lead speaking role among the disciples. After him Judas Iscariot follows in Matthew; John the Disciple follows in both Mark and Luke; but Thomas has that honor in John. In light of John’s stated purpose (Joh 20:31), Thomas’ struggle to believe that Jesus rose from the dead was a key way for John to underscore the importance of faith and the trustworthiness of the testimony of those who were the first eyewitnesses of Jesus’ resurrection. We are often too harsh on Thomas, nicknaming him “doubting” (20:25) when in fact he also modeled radical commitment. He was the first to express his willingness to lay down his life for the Lord. His statement, “Let’s go also, that we may die with him.” (11:16) may not have been overly optimistic and hope-filled, but it certainly expressed a willing, committed heart! To what lengths will you go in your walk with Jesus?</p>"

    "html": "<h6>Good news to all people</h6><p>An explosion that’s still shaking the world</p><h6>How to read Acts</h6><p>After his death Jesus’ ministry continued in the life of the early church and continues today through the lives of his people. Acts is the story of those early believers, who sought to apply what it meant to live out the missional teaching of Jesus in their day through the power of the Holy Spirit. Their story is our encouragement: despite difficulties, the church can survive and even thrive. Transformation, revival, and church growth come, not through human effort alone, but in partnership with the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Thirty years of history are covered, yet every page abounds with precise details and dramatic descriptions. The opening chapters tell how the church began to be multiplied, through the presence and the power of the Spirit. Dynamic growth happened as the gospel broke down age-old cultural walls between Jews and Gentiles. The church then expanded its witness geographically far beyond Jerusalem. Peter and Paul are the key characters in these stories: Peter as an anchor for Jewish believers in Jerusalem, and Paul striking out into new lands as the church’s first great missionary to the Gentiles.</p><p>We have inherited the promise and the mandate Jesus first entrusted to these believers. The same Holy Spirit so active in Acts is still at work in our story today, so let us draw on the zeal and faith of our earliest brothers and sisters. It is now our turn to be his witnesses “to the uttermost parts of the earth” (Act 1:8).</p><h6>Who wrote this book and when?</h6><p>Luke, the author of the gospel that bears his name, wrote Acts in approximately AD 63–70. The books of Luke and Acts compose almost one-fourth of the New Testament.</p><h6>To whom was it written and why?</h6><p>As an historian, Luke wrote to Theophilus (a name that means “lover of God”) to tell what happened after Jesus’ resurrection. Acts is the second volume of the Good News—the sequel to the gospel. In it Luke explained Christianity’s amazing growth, perhaps to legitimize the church to civil authorities or to confirm the faith of believers. Luke may also have wanted believers to understand how the Spirit was working to do away with the historic conflict between Jews and Gentiles.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>There are two lead actors in Acts: Peter and Paul. Peter speaks a total of 36 times —31 times alone and 5 times together with others. Paul speaks a total of 56 times —53 times alone and 3 times together with others. The words of these two fill more than one-fourth of the text of Acts (Peter 10 percent and Paul 16 percent). Consider these parallels:<br /><br /><table style='max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 18px'> <tr> <th colspan='3' style='text-align: center'>Parallels Between Peter and Paul in Acts</th></tr><tr> <th style='width: 50%; font-weight: bold'>Both...</th> <th style='width: 25%; font-weight: bold'>Peter</th> <th style='width: 25%; font-weight: bold'>Paul</th> </tr><tr> <th>heal a cripple from birth</th> <th>3:6</th> <th>14:10</th> </tr><tr> <th>were plotted against</th> <th>4:1-3; 5:17-18; 12:2-5</th> <th>9:23-25,29; 13:45-50; 14:19; 16:19-39; 17:5-9,13; 19:23-41; 20:3; 21:27-35; 23:12-15; 25:2-3</th> </tr><tr> <th>testify before the Jewish high council</th> <th>4:5-22; 5:17-41</th> <th>22:30-23:10</th> </tr><tr> <th>do extraordinary miracles</th> <th>5:15-16</th> <th>19:11-12</th> </tr><tr> <th>are supernaturally released from prison</th> <th>5:18-25; 12:6-16</th> <th>16:23-40</th> </tr><tr> <th>preach boldly amidst persecution</th> <th>5:21</th> <th>14:20</th> </tr><tr> <th>pray for Holy Spirit baptism</th> <th>8:17</th> <th>19:6</th> </tr><tr> <th>encounter a sorcerer</th> <th>8:18-24</th> <th>13:8-11</th> </tr><tr> <th>raise the dead</th> <th>9:36-42</th> <th>20:7-12</th> </tr><tr> <th>have a 'Gentile' vision</th> <th>10:10-16</th> <th>16:9-10</th> </tr><tr> <th>are worshiped by men</th> <th>10:25</th> <th>14:11-18</th> </tr><tr> <th>preach to Roman official's household</th> <th>10:24</th> <th>16:31</th> </tr><tr> <th>'Conversion' told 1st time</th> <th>10:1-47</th> <th>9:1-22</th> </tr><tr> <th>'Conversion' told 2nd time</th> <th>11:4-18</th> <th>22:3-21</th> </tr><tr> <th>'Conversion' told 3rd time</th> <th>15:7-11</th> <th>26:2-23</th> </tr></table><br />Read and reflect on the three longest speeches of each of these two lead actors, noting the similarities and differences between them.<br /><br />Peter’s main speeches are:</p><ul>  <li>His message in the temple of Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (1:20-22; 2:14-36; 2:38-39);</li><br /><li>His message in the temple of Jerusalem after healing a man lame from birth (3:12-26);</li><br /><li>His testimony to the believers in Jerusalem after meeting with Cornelius (11:5-15; 11:15-17).</li></ul><p><br />Paul’s main speeches are:</p><ul>  <li>His message in the synagogue of Antioch of Pisidia on the first missionary journey (13:16, 13:16-41);</li><br /><li>His testimony in the temple of Jerusalem at the time of his arrest (22:1; 22:3-21);</li><br /><li>His testimony in Caesarea before Herod Agrippa and Governor Porcius Festus (26:2-23; 26:25-27; 26:29).</li></ul><p><br />In addition to Peter and Paul, there are an additional 61 speaking parts in Acts including individuals and groups, human, demonic, and angelic.

    "html": "<h6>The power of God for salvation</h6><p>The gospel—the divine solution for humanity’s common need</p><h6>How to read Romans</h6><p>The ultimate power for a transformed life is the power of God. Romans reveals that God has won the victory over sin and death through Jesus, who paid the penalty by dying in our place. He broke sin’s enslaving power over us. Through God’s power, Christians can reflect the attitudes and actions of those who are deeply loved by God. A prayerful study of Romans will uncover the key to the Spirit-filled life: a simple and ongoing response of faith in Jesus and his work on the cross. Be prepared! Martin Luther, John Wesley, and many other notable persons of faith found their lives transformed by the message of this book. They then went on to become world-changers as they applied the truth that faith is all that is necessary to become acceptable to God. Like these men and women of God, take hold of this book until its message takes hold of you!</p><p>Romans is one of the most highly organized books in the New Testament. After a brief introduction, Paul declares that all humans, regardless of background or nationality, are sinners and thus are not able to have a relationship with God (Rom 1:18-3:20). Next he explains how God justly dealt with sin, making the divine-human friendship possible (Rom 3:21-8:39). Paul then argues that our faith in response to God’s work through the cross is the key for our justification (salvation) and continues to be the way to gain access to the power of the indwelling Christ in order to say no to sin and yes to God. In chapters 9-11 Paul summarizes how God’s redemptive work through history has prepared a way for the Jews as well as for people of every other nation (Gentiles) to benefit from his gift of grace through Jesus’ death on the cross. In the final five chapters you’ll receive practical guidance on how to live out your faith in unity with other believers so that “that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom 15:6).</p><h6>Who wrote this book and when?</h6><p>The apostle Paul, who wrote about the grace of God both from experience (Act 9:1-19) and education (Act 22:3), wrote these words about AD 57.</p><h6>To whom was it written and why?</h6><p>Paul wrote to predominantly Gentile believers in the capital city of the Roman Empire:</p><ol>  <li>to introduce himself to the believers there and enlist their help in spreading the gospel;</li><br /><li>to develop and defend the truth of the gospel he had been preaching; and</li><br /><li>to encourage the Roman believers to rely solely on God’s grace for their salvation (Rom 3:24).</li></ol><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>Romans is the first of twenty books in the New Testament that are actually letters written to either an individual or a group. Paul wrote thirteen of these letters—each of his letters bears the name of the intended recipient. The final seven letters were authored by various church leaders—and each is named after its respective author.</p><p>Reading these letters is like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. You actually do not hear the dialogue, but you are aware that what you are hearing is part of a larger, ongoing conversation between several parties. Because these letters contain only one side of that dialogue, all the SourceView text is in black. Though the letters are embedded in a dramatic life narrative, they themselves do not contain dramatic textual interchange.</p><p>In order to help us relive the experience that it must have been for the original recipients to have read these divinely-inspired letters, we have displayed the letters with a cursive script to recreate the original handwritten feel of these very personal documents. None of the letters takes long to read, so pick one up and read it from beginning to end at one sitting—just like you would if you received a letter from a dear friend. Reading these letters does not take nearly as long as you may think. They average less than 20 minutes a book! Here are some time frames to give you an idea of how long it might take to read each of the New Testament letters:</p><br /><table style='max-width:300px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 18px'><tr><th>Letter</th><th>Read Time</th></tr><tr><th>Romans</th><th>1 hour</th></tr><tr><th>1 Corinthians</th><th>1 hour</th></tr><tr><th>2 Corinthians</th><th>1 hour</th></tr><tr><th>Galatians</th><th>20 Minutes</th></tr><tr><th>Ephesians</th><th>20 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>Philippians</th><th>15 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>Colossians</th><th>15 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>1 Thessalonians</th><th>15 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>2 Thessalonians</th><th>10 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>1 Timothy</th><th>15 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>2 Timothy</th><th>10 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>Titus</th><th>10 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>Philemon</th><th>5 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>Hebrews</th><th>45 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>James</th><th>15 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>1 Peter</th><th>15 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>2 Peter</th><th>10 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>1 John</th><th>15 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>2 John</th><th>5 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>3 John</th><th>5 minutes</th></tr><tr><th>Jude</th><th>5 minutes</th></tr></table>"

Few other passages of scripture reveal the weaknesses of Christians as vividly as this book does. Some other topics include: Dealing with a sex-crazed society. Divorce—when is it justified? When Christians can and cannot sue. Get ready! You’re about to encounter God’s perspective on some hot topics. And in the process you will see how to encourage believers to make a godly impact on today’s world.</p><p>Notice how Paul sees believers as ones who are holy and called—in spite of their sometimes unholy behavior. Watch how he skillfully strives to wake them up to the fact that they are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit (1Co 3:16; 6:19). Look for the obvious emotions that filled Paul’s heart as he wrote this letter. You will observe a wide range of moods expressed here, from anger to shame to sorrow to tenderness. He longs for believers to adjust their behavior to reflect the righteousness of Jesus. Paul’s words correct jealousies and pride, steering people away from extremes that undermine Christian unity and love. This book deserves repeated readings. Your time will be well spent as you examine areas in your own life where you may need to make a change.</p><h6>Who wrote this book and when?</h6><p>The apostle Paul wrote it about AD 54 or 55.</p><h6>To whom was it written?</h6><p>Christians in Corinth, an important commercial city in Greece.</p><h6>Why was it written?</h6><p>Two or three years after leaving the church he’d started in Corinth, Paul heard disturbing reports: Strife and division were seriously threatening the young church.

    "html": "<h6>No additives needed</h6><p>A call to hold fast to the liberating truth of the gospel</p><h6>How to read Galatians</h6><p>People who care about nutrition often read the labels before buying packaged foods. Why? To check for additives and ingredients that may be harmful. In a similar way, Galatians describes the toxic effect of mixing legalism and human works into the simple gospel. This book offers a spiritual health check—a clear explanation of what it means to be saved by faith.</p><p>The usual format of a common first-century letter follows a different pattern from what we are accustomed to today. The expected literary flow would begin by stating who the letter was from and to whom it was directed (like an email header). Then this would be followed by a brief greeting and a prayer of blessing or thanksgiving before proceeding to the main body of the correspondence. But this was no normal letter. After the expected cross-cultural greeting (“grace” for Gentiles and “peace” for Jews—the normal terms used by Greek-speakers and Hebrew-speakers; Gal 1:3), Paul forgoes the prayer of blessing. Instead he curses his readers! Twice! (see Gal 1:6-10). Wow! Now he had their attention! Does he have yours? He didn’t care about literary conventions. He wanted to rescue his beloved Galatians from the danger of following a false gospel.</p><p>Paul proceeds with a passionate and dramatic retelling of his own encounter with Christ. He vehemently shares ministry highlights that establish his credentials as an apostle. His own experience of how Jesus changed his life is what has equipped him to be a defender of the true gospel of salvation by grace through faith. Next he unpacks a number of Old Testament characters to illustrate that the gospel he proclaims is in keeping with God’s purposes ever since the days of Abraham! If this is true then there is no more room for bondage to old legalistic religious systems. He practically shouts, “Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage” (Gal 5:1). He then explains the practical implications of the gospel upon a life set free by grace and lived out under the control of the Holy Spirit. This life is characterized by “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, and self-control” (Gal 5:22-23).</p><p>Galatians will take you back to the basics—what the gospel is, how you receive it, and how you can apply it in your daily life. At times, Paul gets downright feisty, even resorting to sarcasm, to grab the Galatians’ attention and win them back to a gospel of liberty. May his passion jolt you back into the shocking news of just how free we are in Christ!</p><h6>Who wrote this book and when?</h6><p>Paul, the apostle, wrote it probably after completing the first missionary journey (Act 13-14) and just before the council of Jerusalem (Act 15). The disagreement mentioned by Paul in Act 15:2 could well be the story that Paul describes in Gal 2:11-16. It seems that after his run-in with Peter in Antioch, Paul wrote this passionate epistle, as he was preparing for the debate that would ensue in Jerusalem. This would have taken place about 25 years after Jesus’ death and resurrection.</p><h6>To whom was it written and why?</h6><p>To Christians in Galatia, a Roman province in the central part of what is now called Turkey, to denounce and correct false teachings that had infiltrated the churches Paul and Barnabas had earlier established. False teachers insisted that Gentile Christians had to keep the ritual laws of the Jews. Paul, stinging from personal attacks against him, also wrote to defend his integrity as an apostle and to reassert his love for the Galatians.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>This letter contains only one side of Paul’s dialogue with the Galatians, so all the SourceView text is in black.

Paul shines the spotlight on the glory and majesty of Christ and the life he’s given us as the best antidote to the toxic counterfeit teachings in the culture surrounding this young church. Jesus—who he is, what he’s done, what it’s like to live in him—are center stage. Paul uses the richest language to try to capture the amazing qualities of our extraordinary God!</p><p>In the first two chapters, Paul confronts heresy with a one-two punch. First, he declares that Jesus is not only the Creator and Sustainer of everything, but he is in fact the exact representation of God. Nothing less than “all the fullness” dwells in him (Col 1:17-19). Second, Paul exposes the false idea that philosophy and religiosity can successfully combat evil desires (Col 2:23). He reminds the Colossians that believers already have what they need for spiritual victory through “union with Christ” (Col 2:10).</p><p>In the last two chapters, Paul makes it clear: If you want to do the will of God, set your mind on Jesus and focus on the life we have received “in him.” As you read, be prepared! Your relationship with Jesus could be raised to a whole new level. As you acknowledge Jesus as Lord over your attitudes and actions and place your life under his rule, you will grow in holiness.

Paul countered this supposedly “secret” (gnostic) sect and its hybrid of religion and philosophy that mixed Christian, Jewish, and pagan beliefs. He stated that the time of religious secrets is over! “... I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God,  the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations.

He states, “concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works.

Because this trip is not recorded in Luke’s account of Paul’s travels, many suggest that it was written sometime after the events recorded in the books of history.

In this scenario, he may have set out from Troas in Cilicia with a young Titus as his ministry companion.

When the pressure is on, we may be tempted to give up. We need a reminder of what we’re contending for to get us through those tough spots. Hebrews was written for just such a situation. It was for Jewish followers of Jesus who were facing really severe persecution because of their faith. In light of the hardship, some had considered abandoning the faith altogether. The author exhorts them to keep going regardless of the price. Why?</p><p>The reason is simple. Nothing—and no one—compares to Jesus!</p><p>He is better than the angels, better than Moses, better than Joshua, better than Aaron, better than Melchizedek. Indeed, he instituted a better covenant based on better promises resulting in a better rest because he’s made a better sacrifice—giving his very own life. In fact, if you were to consider all the great heroes of the faith, Jesus is better yet! That is why we must “consider ... Jesus” (Heb 3:1) and keep “looking to Jesus” him and him alone (Heb 12:2). He is better than better—he is the best there is! The stirring conclusion is clear: Because Jesus is beyond compare, it is worth following him no matter what it costs!</p><p>The writer makes frequent contrasts between Old Testament ritual law and New Testament faith. Notice the strong appeals made to persuade the Jewish believers to stick with the new covenant rather than going back to the old. Look for the vivid Old Testament images used to illustrate what God has done through Jesus Christ. Read the stories of those who endured through the Old Testament, clinging to faith and grace in anticipation of the Christ, “desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one” (Heb 11:16). Delight in the fabulous descriptions of the incomparable life and nature of our great Messiah. And determine in your heart to treasure Jesus above all else—that’s when you know you’ve really got the message of Hebrews!</p><h6>Who wrote this book?</h6><p>This is a debated question. The answer is unclear because the author does not identify him or herself. Though some have suggested it was written by Paul, it is more likely written by one of his trusted Jewish associates: Barnabas, Apollos, or Priscilla. The fact that the document remained anonymous may point strongly to the female authorship of Priscilla.</p><h6>When was it written?</h6><p>The nature of the persecution described in the letter indicates a time in which there was no social stigma for being a Jew, but there was for being a follower of Jesus. The author says, “partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so. For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens” (Heb 10:33-34). This could indicate the time of persecution under Emperor Nero, perhaps after Peter and Paul’s martyrdom, sometime in the late AD 60s. Note that Timothy—Paul’s close companion—had just been “freed” (Heb 13:23).</p><h6>To whom was it written and why?</h6><p>Are there times when you would prefer not to identify yourself with Christ because of social pressures and cultural perceptions? Then you may be able to understand somewhat the dilemma facing these early Jewish believers. Because of the particular nature of the persecution they were experiencing, it was safe to be known as a Jew, but it was potentially life-threatening to be identified as a Christian. Therefore, Hebrews sounded a warning to these early Jewish believers who were being tempted to revert to their Old Testament rituals in an attempt to escape persecution and save their families, their businesses, their lives. Hebrews exhorts them that the “new and life-giving way” of faith in Jesus is better! (Heb 10:20).</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>Though sometimes it is referred to as an epistle, Hebrews is actually not a letter. It does not contain the expected elements of a first-century letter. It does not state who wrote it nor to whom it was written. It contains no initial greeting or prayer of blessing. Instead, it refers to itself as a “word of exhortation” (Heb 13:22) for it takes only 45 minutes to read. Apparently then, what we have before us is the transcript of an inspired sermon. But this is not just a religious message. It is more like a political rally!</p><p>This exhortation patterns itself after a form of political speech common in the Roman era known as a synkrisis. In this genre of speech, the advocate of a candidate would deliver a message comparing the candidate with famous persons in the city’s past. In every instance the candidate would be declared to be better than the predecessor. If the political speech was effective, the hearers would break into enthusiastic partisan cheers, chanting loudly the name of the candidate for whom they would vote! In the same way the author of Hebrews lifted up Jesus and expected the hearers to end “proclaiming our allegiance to his name” (Heb 13:15), aligning themselves unswervingly with Jesus—even when facing persecution!</p><p>At the same time, the author conveys a deep caring, pastoral concern for her or his fellow-believers who are going through these rough times. The author identifies with the hearers and places the words of Psalm 118:6 into their own mouths, saying, “So that with good courage we say, ‘The Lord is my helper. I will not fear. What can man do to me?’” (Heb 13:6).</p><p>Time and again the author empathizes with the persecuted believers, using first person plural language (“we, our, ours, us”) to identify with these original hearers of this synkrisis. Consider what is written in 1:1, 2, 3; 2:1,3, 5, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18; 3:1, 6, 14, 19; 4:1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16; 5:11; 6:1, 3, 9, 11, 18, 19, 20; 7:8, 9, 13, 14, 26; 8:1, 3, 6; 9:5, 12, 14, 24, 28; 10:10, 12, 19, 21-26, 29, 30, 39; 11:1, 3, 4, 40; 12:1, 2, 9, 10, 25, 28, 29; 13:10, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 23. The pastoral empathy exhibited in these passages should be an inspiration for us to live our lives in a similar way: identifying closely with those who are undergoing persecution for their faith in the amazing person of Jesus Christ.</p>"

John tells us “how great a love the Father has given to us” and then affirms that “we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is. Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.” (1Jo 3:1-3).</p><p>What does it look like to live life as God’s beloved?

You would think that with the need to contend against so much false teaching, Jude would be somewhat discouraged. Just the opposite is true! He’s more impressed with God’s capacity to keep us in his ways than with the enemy’s attempts to divert us. His final song of praise exudes great joy and confidence: “Now to him who is able to keep them from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy, 25 to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen” (verses 24-25).</p><h6>Who wrote this book and when?</h6><p>Jude was the half-brother of Jesus and full brother of James (author of James). He may have written this letter around the time Peter wrote his second letter, between AD 60 and 65. These two letters have striking similarities.</p><h6>Why was it written?</h6><p>Jude was concerned that Christians might be drawn away from the truth by slippery teachers of false doctrine. He wrote to urge believers “to contend earnestly for the faith” (verse 3).</p><h6>What was happening at the time?</h6><p>Impostors had begun to teach things contrary to the gospel and were causing confusion in the church.

    "html": "<h6>Contend for the faith</h6><p>When evil abounds, hold on to God because he holds on to you</p><h6>How to read Jude</h6><p>Ever disconnect the smoke detector or the seatbelt buzzer because you didn’t want to be bothered with the irritating noise? Ignoring such warnings could cost you your home or your life. But ignoring spiritual warnings could be even worse. That’s why we should pay close attention to this book. Jude sounds a short sharp warning siren we dare not ignore.<br />   Jude doesn’t waste words as he describes what’s wrong and what to do about it. He makes it crystal clear that we’ve got to take a stand for the truth and contend for the faith. As you read, you might want to flip back and forth with 2 Peter. Observe how many parallels there are between these two books as they both seek to combat false teaching in the church.<br />   As you read Jude’s compelling words, be attentive to the warnings, but also notice the promises and the encouragement to live genuine Christian lives. You would think that with the need to contend against so much false teaching, Jude would be somewhat discouraged. Just the opposite is true! He’s more impressed with God’s capacity to keep us in his ways than with the enemy’s attempts to divert us. His final song of praise exudes great joy and confidence: “Now all glory to God, who is able to keep you from falling away and will bring you with great joy into his glorious presence without a single fault. All glory to him who alone is God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord. All glory, majesty, power, and authority are his before all time, and in the present, and beyond all time! Amen” (verses 24-25).</p><h6>Who wrote this book and when?</h6><p>Jude was the half-brother of Jesus and full brother of James (author of James). He may have written this letter around the time Peter wrote his second letter, between AD 60 and 65. These two letters have striking similarities.</p><h6>Why was it written?</h6><p>Jude was concerned that Christians might be drawn away from the truth by slippery teachers of false doctrine. He wrote to urge believers “to defend the faith” (verse 3).</p><h6>What was happening at the time?</h6><p>Impostors had begun to teach things contrary to the gospel and were causing confusion in the church. They taught it really didn’t matter how people lived if they had been saved by grace. You can imagine the disaster this could produce! Jude wanted to make sure that no believer followed the example of Cain (Gen 4:1-25), Balaam (Num 22:1-24:25), or Korah (Num 16:1-49).</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>Reading Jude’s letter is like listening to a cell phone conversation—one-sided. Therefore, all the SourceView text is in black. We have displayed the letter with a cursive script to recreate the original handwritten feel.</p>"

    "html": "<h6>Jesus’ victory and glory</h6><p>A call to overcome because our God reigns!</p><h6>How to read Revelation</h6><p>When the story gets so bleak and the bad guys are winning, it’s a relief to sneak a peek at the end of the book—the good guys DO win in the end! Revelation reminds us that in the end justice and mercy triumph over evil, and every sorrow is comforted. Because Jesus has won the victory over sin and death, we are exhorted to live lives consistent with God’s coming kingdom.</p><p>This great prophecy is the climactic book of the New Testament. The four gospels describe Jesus’ life on earth. The many letters describe the ministry of the resurrected Christ. Revelation presents Jesus Christ as the glorious coming King who deserves your love, worship, and total allegiance. The assurance of his ultimate victory gives each of us courage to persevere in the midst of life’s challenges. Our confidence lies in the hope that the world will “become the Kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!” (Rev 11:15).</p><h6>Who wrote this book?</h6><p>Probably John, the apostle who also wrote the gospel of John and the three letters that bear his name.</p><h6>When was it written?</h6><p>Several dates are suggested. The most favored is AD 90–96, near the end of the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian, about the time his persecution of the church began. These dark days required the light of hope of a victorious future.</p><h6>To whom was it written and why?</h6><p>This book went to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia (present-day Turkey) to warn them against falling away from their faith in Jesus Christ. It also offered them assurance of ultimate victory through the King of Kings and Lord of Lords who has the future firmly in hand.</p><h6>SourceView Insights</h6><p>Revelation certainly has an interesting speaking cast! John speaks through The Narrator (in black—61.6 percent) and as himself (in green—only 0.1 percent). God has much to say (in red—21.2 percent), but perhaps the most intriguing part is that comprised of the other 36 cast members (in blue—17.1 percent). Like Zechariah in the Old Testament we listen to the words of an extraordinary collection of out-of-this-world beings:</p><ul>  <li>We hear the voices of a wide assortment of celestial creatures (24 Elders, One of the 24 Elders, Four Living Beings, First Living Being, Second Living Being, Third Living Being, Fourth Living Being, One of the Seven Angels, A Third Angel, A Seventh Angel, A First Angel Flying, A Second Angel Flying, A Third Angel Flying, A Guiding Angel, A Mighty Angel Standing, A Strong Angel, An Angel from the East, An Angel from the Temple, An Angel in the Sun, An Angel with a Boulder, An Angel with a Sickle, An Angel with Authority, Millions of Angels, All the Angels, and—interestingly—An Eagle).</li><br /><li>We also hear the words of the many redeemed (All Who Hear, All the Redeemed, All the Martyrs, All People, Every Creature, and A Vast Heavenly Crowd).</li><br /><li>And, sadly, we hear the voices of a few who refused to embrace the kingdom of God (The World’s Merchants, The World’s Shippers, and The World’s Rulers).</li><br /><li>It is worthy of note that neither Satan nor his demonic hosts get a word in edgewise!</li></ul><p>You might still be approaching this book with some apprehension. Perhaps you are thinking, “There are so many mysterious things in it, how can I possibly understand it?” While many of the images are indeed unusual, there is much that is easily comprehensible in Revelation. Some of the first words of The Narrator and some of the final words spoken by God point us in the direction of increased understanding. Note the similarity between these two:</p><ul>  <li>“Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is at hand” (1:3).</li><br /><li>“Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book” (22:7).</li></ul><p>Apparently the author thought that the main ideas were clear enough that the reader could readily understand and apply them. What is there to obey in this book? Well, there are over 120 imperatives throughout the book. The Narrator gives some clear commands (like “come ... take the water of life freely” in Rev 22:17) as do a variety of angels, including A First Angel Flying (“Fear the Lord ... give him glory … Worship him ...” in Rev 14:7) and A Guiding Angel (“don’t do it! I am a fellow bondservant ... Worship God ...” in Rev 19:10 and again in 22:9).</p><p>But the greatest number of imperatives come directly from the mouth of God and are found in the red text. In fact 20 of the 28 red passages in Revelation contain clear commands for us to obey (Can you find them all?). The greatest number are concentrated in Rev 1:17b-3:22: “Don’t be afraid ... write … write … remember ... repent … do the first works … hear what the Spirit says ... write ... don’t be afraid ... be faithful ... hear what the Spirit says ... write ... repent ... hear what the Spirit says ... write ... hold that which you have ... hear what the Spirit says ... write ... wake up ... keep the things that remain ... remember ... keep it ... repent ... hear what the Spirit says ... write ... Hold firmly that which you have ... hear what the Spirit ... write ... buy from me gold ... white garments ... and eye salve to anoint your eyes ... Be zealous … repent ... hear what the Spirit says ...”</p><p>The repetition is purposeful. Are the key themes starting to emerge for you? Don’t be afraid ... wake up ... repent ... keep ... hear what the Spirit says ...</p><p>If we go back to (1:3) and (22:7), we realize that these two passages not only speak of obeying the message of this book, but also of the blessings that accompany that act of obedience. There are another five passages in Revelation that also speak of being blessed. They state:</p><ul>  <li>“Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them” (14:13)</li><br /><li>“Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn’t walk naked, and they see his shame” (16:15)</li><br /><li>“Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb” (19:9)</li><br /><li>“Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection” (20:6a)</li><br /><li>“Blessed are those who do his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city” (22:14)</li></ul>"
